<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>graph.famous</code> knows the following graphs:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>BullThe bull graph, 5 vertices, 5 edges, resembles to the
head of a bull if drawn properly.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>ChvatalThis is the smallest triangle-free graph that is
both 4-chromatic and 4-regular. According to the Grunbaum
conjecture there exists an m-regular, m-chromatic graph
with n vertices for every m&gt;1 and n&gt;2. The Chvatal graph
is an example for m=4 and n=12. It has 24 edges.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>CoxeterA non-Hamiltonian cubic symmetric graph with 28
vertices and 42 edges.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>CubicalThe Platonic graph of the cube. A convex regular
polyhedron with 8 vertices and 12 edges.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>DiamondA graph with 4 vertices and 5 edges, resembles to a
schematic diamond if drawn properly.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dodecahedral, DodecahedronAnother Platonic solid
with 20 vertices and 30 edges.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>FolkmanThe semisymmetric graph with minimum number of
vertices, 20 and 40 edges. A semisymmetric graph is
regular, edge transitive and not vertex transitive.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>FranklinThis is a graph whose embedding to the Klein
bottle can be colored with six colors, it is a
counterexample to the neccessity of the Heawood
conjecture on a Klein bottle. It has 12 vertices and 18
edges.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>FruchtThe Frucht Graph is the smallest cubical graph
whose automorphism group consists only of the identity
element. It has 12 vertices and 18 edges.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>GrotzschThe Grötzsch graph is a triangle-free graph with
11 vertices, 20 edges, and chromatic number 4. It is named after
German mathematician Herbert Grötzsch, and its existence
demonstrates that the assumption of planarity is necessary in
Grötzsch's theorem that every triangle-free planar
graph is 3-colorable.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>HeawoodThe Heawood graph is an undirected graph with 14
vertices and 21 edges. The graph is cubic, and all cycles in the
graph have six or more edges. Every smaller cubic graph has shorter
cycles, so this graph is the 6-cage, the smallest cubic graph of
girth 6.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>HerschelThe Herschel graph is the smallest
nonhamiltonian polyhedral graph. It is the
unique such graph on 11 nodes, and has 18 edges.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>HouseThe house graph is a 5-vertex, 6-edge graph, the
schematic draw of a house if drawn properly, basicly a 
triangle of the top of a square.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>HouseXThe same as the house graph with an X in the square. 5
vertices and 8 edges.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Icosahedral, IcosahedronA Platonic solid with 12
vertices and 30 edges.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Krackhardt\_KiteA social network with 10 vertices and 18 edges.
Krackhardt, D. Assessing the Political Landscape:
Structure, Cognition, and Power in Organizations.
Admin. Sci. Quart. 35, 342-369, 1990.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>LeviThe graph is a 4-arc transitive cubic graph, it has
30 vertices and 45 edges.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>McGeeThe McGee graph is the unique 3-regular 7-cage
graph, it has 24 vertices and 36 edges.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>MeredithThe Meredith graph is a quartic graph on 70
nodes and 140 edges that is a counterexample to the conjecture that
every 4-regular 4-connected graph is Hamiltonian.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>NoperfectmatchingA connected graph with 16 vertices and
27 edges containing no perfect matching. A matching in a graph
is a set of pairwise non-adjacent edges; that is, no two edges
share a common vertex. A perfect matching is a matching
which covers all vertices of the graph.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>NonlineA graph whose connected components are the 9
graphs whose presence as a vertex-induced subgraph in a
graph makes a nonline graph. It has 50 vertices and 72 edges.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Octahedral, OctahedronPlatonic solid with 6
vertices and 12 edges. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p>PetersenA 3-regular graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges. It is
the smallest hypohamiltonian graph, ie. it is
non-hamiltonian but removing any single vertex from it makes it
Hamiltonian.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>RobertsonThe unique (4,5)-cage graph, ie. a 4-regular
graph of girth 5. It has 19 vertices and 38 edges.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>SmallestcyclicgroupA smallest nontrivial graph
whose automorphism group is cyclic. It has 9 vertices and
15 edges.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tetrahedral, TetrahedronPlatonic solid with 4
vertices and 6 edges.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>ThomassenThe smallest hypotraceable graph,
on 34 vertices and 52 edges. A hypotracable graph does
not contain a Hamiltonian path but after removing any
single vertex from it the remainder always contains a
Hamiltonian path. A graph containing a Hamiltonian path
is called tracable.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>TutteTait's Hamiltonian graph conjecture states that
every 3-connected 3-regular planar graph is Hamiltonian.
This graph is a counterexample. It has 46 vertices and 69
edges.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Uniquely3colorableReturns a 12-vertex, triangle-free
graph with chromatic number 3 that is uniquely
3-colorable.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>WaltherAn identity graph with 25 vertices and 31
edges. An identity graph has a single graph automorphism,
the trivial one.
</p>
