<h2>Community structure detecting based on the leading eigenvector
of the community matrix</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These functions try to find densely connected subgraphs in
a graph by calculating the leading non-negative eigenvector of the
modularity matrix of the graph.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
leading.eigenvector.community(graph, steps = -1,
       options = igraph.arpack.default)
leading.eigenvector.community.naive(graph, steps = -1,
       options = igraph.arpack.default)
leading.eigenvector.community.step (graph, fromhere = NULL,
    membership = rep(0, vcount(graph)), community = 0,
    options=igraph.arpack.default)
community.le.to.membership(merges, steps, membership) 
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>The input graph. Should be undirected as the method needs
a symmetric matrix.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>steps</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of steps to take, this is actually the number
of tries to make a step. It is not a particularly useful parameter.
</p>
<p>For <code>community.le.to.membership</code> the number of merges to
produce from the supplied <code>membership</code> vector.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>naive</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical constant, it defines how the algorithm tries to
find more divisions after the first division was made. If
<code>TRUE</code> then it simply considers both communities as separate
graphs and then creates modularity matrices for both communities,
etc. This method however does not maximize modularity, see the paper
in the references section below. If it is <code>FALSE</code> then the
proper method is used which maximizes modularity.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>fromhere</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object returned by a previous call to
<code>leading.eigenvector.community.step</code>. This will serve as a
starting point to take another step. This argument is ignored if it
is <code>NULL</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>membership</code></td>
<td>
<p>The starting community structure. It is a numeric
vector defining the membership of every vertex in the graph with a
number between 0 and the total number of communities at this level
minus one. By default we start with a single community containing
all vertices. This argument is ignored if <code>fromhere</code> is not
<code>NULL</code>.
</p>
<p>For <code>community.le.to.memberhip</code> the starting community
structure on which <code>steps</code> merges are performed.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>community</code></td>
<td>
<p>The id of the community which the algorithm will try
to split.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>options</code></td>
<td>
<p>A named list to override some ARPACK options.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>merges</code></td>
<td>
<p>The merge matrix, possible from the result of
<code>leading.eigenvector.community</code>.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The functions documented in these section implement the 
&lsquo;leading eigenvector&rsquo; method developed by Mark Newman and 
published in MEJ Newman: Finding community structure using the
eigenvectors of matrices, arXiv:physics/0605087. TODO: proper
citation.
</p>
<p>The heart of the method is the definition of the modularity matrix,
<code>B</code>, which is <code>B=A-P</code>, <code>A</code> being the adjacency matrix of
the (undirected) 
network, and <code>P</code> contains the probability that certain edges are
present according to the &lsquo;configuration model&rsquo;. In
other words, a <code>P[i,j]</code> element of <code>P</code> is the probability that
there is an edge between vertices <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> in a random
network in which the degrees of all vertices are the same as in the
input graph.
</p>
<p>The leading eigenvector method works by calculating the eigenvector
of the modularity matrix for the largest positive eigenvalue and
then separating vertices into two community based on the sign of
the corresponding element in the eigenvector. If all elements in
the eigenvector are of the same sign that means that the network
has no underlying comuunity structure.
Check Newman's paper to understand why this is a good method for
detecting community structure.
</p>
<p><code>leading.eigenvector.community</code> is the proper implementation of
the proposed algorithm. <code>leading.eigenvector.community.naive</code> is
considered worse, in this implementation a community found after a
division is considered as a separate graph for further divisions.
<code>leading.eigenvector.community.step</code> is the proper
implementation, but makes only one step, by trying to split the
specified community.
</p>
<p>From igraph 0.5 these functions use ARPACK to calculate the
eigenvectors. See <code><a href="arpack.html">arpack</a></code> for details.
</p>
<p><code>community.le.to.memberhip</code> creates a membership vector from the
result of <code>leading.eigenvector.community</code> or
<code>leading.eigenvector.community.naive</code>. It takes <code>membership</code>
and permformes <code>steps</code> merges, according to the supplied
<code>merges</code> matrix.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>leading.eigenvector.community</code> and
<code>leading.eigenvector.community.naive</code> return a named list with
the following members:
</p>
<table summary="R valueblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>membership</code></td>
<td>
<p>The membership vector at the end of the algorithm,
when no more splits are possible.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>merges</code></td>
<td>
<p>The merges matrix starting from the state described by
the <code>membership</code> member. This is a two-column matrix and each
line describes a merge of two communities, the first line is the
first merge and it creates community &lsquo;<code>N</code>&rsquo;, <code>N</code>
is the number of initial communities in the graph, the second line
creates community <code>N+1</code>, etc.
</p>
</td></tr>

<p>Information about the underlying ARPACK computation,
see <code><a href="arpack.html">arpack</a></code> for details.
</p>

<p><code>leading.eigenvector.community.step</code> returns a named list with
the following members:
</p>
<table summary="R valueblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>membership</code></td>
<td>
<p>The new membership vector after the split. If no
split was done then this is the same as the input membership
vector.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>split</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical scalar, if <code>TRUE</code> that means that the
community was successfully splitted.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>eigenvector</code></td>
<td>

<table summary="R valueblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>membership</code></td>
<td>
<p>A membership vector, a numerical vector
indication which vertex belongs to which community. The
