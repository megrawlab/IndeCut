<h2>Neighborhood of graph vertices</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These functions find the vertices not farther than a given
limit from another fixed vertex, these are called the neighborhood of
the vertex.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
neighborhood.size(graph, order, nodes=V(graph), mode=c("all", "out", "in"))
neighborhood(graph, order, nodes=V(graph), mode=c("all", "out", "in"))
graph.neighborhood(graph, order, nodes=V(graph), mode=c("all", "out", "in"))
connect.neighborhood(graph, order, mode=c("all", "out", "in", "total"))
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>The input graph.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>order</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integer giving the order of the neighborhood.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>nodes</code></td>
<td>
<p>The vertices for which the calculation is performed.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>mode</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character constatnt, it specifies how to use the direction
of the edges if a directed graph is analyzed. For &lsquo;out&rsquo; only
the outgoing edges are followed, so all vertices reachable from the
source vertex in at most <code>order</code> steps are counted. For
&lsquo;&quot;in&quot;&rsquo; all vertices from which the source vertex is reachable
in at most <code>order</code> steps are counted. &lsquo;&quot;all&quot;&rsquo; ignores
the direction of the edges. This argument is ignored for undirected
graphs.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The neighborhood of a given order <code>o</code> of a vertex <code>v</code>
includes all vertices which are closer to <code>v</code> than the
order. Ie. order 0 is always <code>v</code> itself, order 1 is <code>v</code>
plus its immediate neighbors, order 2 is order 1 plus the immediate
neighbors of the vertices in order 1, etc.
</p>
<p><code>neighborhood.size</code> calculates the size of the neighborhoods for
the given vertices with the given order.
</p>
<p><code>neighborhood</code> calculates the neighborhoods of the given vertices
with the given order parameter.
</p>
<p><code>graph.neighborhood</code> is creates (sub)graphs from all neighborhoods of
the given vertices with the given order parameter. This function
preserves the vertex, edge and graph attributes.
</p>
<p><code>connect.neighborhood</code> creates a new graph by connecting each
vertex to all other vertices in its neighborhood.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>neighborhood.size</code> returns with an integer vector.
</p>
<p><code>neighborhood</code> returns with a list of integer vectors.
</p>
<p><code>graph.neighborhood</code> returns with a list of graphs.
</p>
<p><code>connect.neighborhood</code> returns with a new graph object.
