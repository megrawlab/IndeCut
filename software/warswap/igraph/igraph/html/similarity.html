<h2>Similarity measures of two vertices</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These functions calculates similarity scores for vertices based on
their connection patterns.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
similarity.jaccard(graph, vids = V(graph), mode = c("all", "out", "in",
      "total"), loops = FALSE) 
similarity.dice(graph, vids = V(graph), mode = c("all", "out", "in",
      "total"), loops = FALSE)
similarity.invlogweighted(graph, vids = V(graph),
       mode = c("all", "out", "in", "total"))
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>The input graph.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>vids</code></td>
<td>
<p>The vertex ids for which the similarity is calculated.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>mode</code></td>
<td>
<p>The type of neighboring vertices to use for the
calculation, possible values: &lsquo;<code>out</code>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<code>in</code>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<code>all</code>&rsquo;.</p>
</td></tr>

<p>Whether to include vertices themselves in the neighbor
sets.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Jaccard similarity coefficient of two vertices is the number of common
neighbors divided by the number of vertices that are neighbors of at
least one of the two vertices being
considered. <code>similarity.jaccard</code> calculates
the pairwise Jaccard similarities for some (or all) of the vertices.
</p>
<p>The Dice similarity coefficient of two vertices is twice the number of common
neighbors divided by the sum of the degrees of the
vertices. <code>similarity.dice</code> calculates the pairwise Dice
similarities for some (or all) of the vertices.
</p>
<p>The inverse log-weighted similarity of two vertices is the number of
their common neighbors, weighted by the inverse logarithm of their degrees.
It is based on the assumption that two vertices should be considered
more similar if they share a low-degree common neighbor, since high-degree
common neighbors are more likely to appear even by pure chance.
Isolated vertices will have zero similarity to any other vertex.
Self-similarities are not calculated.
