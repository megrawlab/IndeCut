<h2>Vertex connectivity.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The vertex connectivity of a graph or two vertices, this is
recently also called group cohesion.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
vertex.connectivity(graph, source=NULL, target=NULL, checks=TRUE)
vertex.disjoint.paths(graph, source, target)
graph.cohesion(graph, checks=TRUE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>The input graph.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>source</code></td>
<td>
<p>The id of the source vertex, for
<code>vertex.connectivity</code> it can be <code>NULL</code>, see details
below.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>target</code></td>
<td>
<p>The id of the target vertex, for
<code>vertex.connectivity</code> it can be <code>NULL</code>, see details
below.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>checks</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical constant. Whether to check that the graph is
connected and also the degree of the vertices. If the graph is
not (strongly) connected then the connectivity is obviously zero. Otherwise
if the minimum degree is one then the vertex connectivity is also
one. It is a good idea to perform these checks, as they can be
done quickly compared to the connectivity calculation itself. 
They were suggested by Peter McMahan, thanks Peter.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The vertex connectivity of two vertices (<code>source</code> and
<code>target</code>) in a directed graph is the minimum number of vertices
needed to remove from the graph to eliminate all (directed) paths from
<code>source</code> to <code>target</code>. <code>vertex.connectivity</code> 
calculates this quantity if both the <code>source</code> and <code>target</code>
arguments are given and they're not <code>NULL</code>.
</p>
<p>The vertex connectivity of a graph is the minimum vertex connectivity
of all (ordered) pairs of vertices in the graph. In other words this
is the minimum number of vertices needed to remove to make the graph
not strongly connected. (If the graph is not strongly connected then
this is zero.) <code>vertex.connectivity</code> calculates this quantitty if
neither the <code>source</code> nor <code>target</code> arguments are
given. (Ie. they are both <code>NULL</code>.)
</p>
<p>A set of vertex disjoint directed paths from <code>source</code> to <code>vertex</code>
is a set of directed paths between them whose vertices do not contain common
vertices (apart from <code>source</code> and <code>target</code>). The maximum number of
vertex disjoint paths between two vertices is the same as their vertex
connectivity. 
</p>
<p>The cohesion of a graph (as defined by White and Harary, see
references), is the vertex connectivity of the graph. This is
calculated by <code>graph.cohesion</code>.
</p>
<p>These three functions essentially calculate the same measure(s), more
precisely <code>vertex.connectivity</code> is the most general, the other
two are included only for the ease of using more descriptive function
names.
