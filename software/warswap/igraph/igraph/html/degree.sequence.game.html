<h2>Generate random graphs with a given degree sequence</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>It is often useful to create a graph with given vertex
degrees. This is exactly what <code>degree.sequence.game</code> does.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
degree.sequence.game(out.deg, in.deg = numeric(0),
     method = c("simple", "vl"), ...) 
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>out.deg</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric vector, the sequence of degrees (for undirected
graphs) or out-degrees (for directed graphs). For undirected graphs
its sum should be even. For directed graphs its sum should be the same
as the sum of <code>in.deg</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>in.deg</code></td>
<td>
<p>For directed graph, the in-degree sequence.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character, the method for generating the graph. Right
now the &ldquo;simple&rdquo; and &ldquo;vl&rdquo; methods are implemented.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Additional arguments, these are used as graph
attributes.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The &ldquo;simple&rdquo; method connects the out-stubs of the
edges (undirected graphs) or the out-stubs and in-stubs
(directed graphs) together. This way loop edges and also multiple
edges may be generated.
</p>
<p>This method is not adequate if one needs to
generate simple graphs with a given degree sequence. The multiple and
loop edges can be deleted, but then the degree sequence is distorted
and there is nothing to ensure that the graphs are sampled uniformly.
</p>
<p>THe &ldquo;vl&rdquo; method is a more sophisticated generator. The
algorithm and the implementation was done by Fabien Viger and Matthieu
Latapy. This generator always generates undirected, connected simple
graphs, it is an error to pass the <code>in.deg</code> argument to it.
The algorithm relies on first creating an initial (possibly
unconnected) simple undirected graph with the given degree sequence
(if this is possible at all). Then some rewiring is done to make the
graph connected. Finally a Monte-Carlo algorithm is used to randomize
the graph. The &ldquo;vl&rdquo; samples from the undirected, connected
simple graphs unformly. See
<a href="http://www-rp.lip6.fr/~latapy/FV/generation.html">http://www-rp.lip6.fr/~latapy/FV/generation.html</a> for details.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
## The simple generator
g &lt;- degree.sequence.game(rep(2,100))
degree(g)
is.simple(g)   # sometimes TRUE, but can be FALSE
g2 &lt;- degree.sequence.game(1:10, 10:1)
degree(g2, mode="out")
degree(g2, mode="in")

## The vl generator
g3 &lt;- degree.sequence.game(rep(2,100), method="vl")
degree(g3)
is.simple(g3)  # always TRUE

## Exponential degree distribution
## Note, that we correct the degree sequence if its sum is odd
degs &lt;- sample(1:100, 100, replace=TRUE, prob=exp(-0.5*(1:100)))
if (sum(degs) %% 2 != 0) { degs[1] &lt;- degs[1] + 1 }
g4 &lt;- degree.sequence.game(degs, method="vl")
all(degree(g4) == degs)

## Power-law degree distribution
## Note, that we correct the degree sequence if its sum is odd
degs &lt;- sample(1:100, 100, replace=TRUE, prob=(1:100)^-2)
if (sum(degs) %% 2 != 0) { degs[1] &lt;- degs[1] + 1 }
g5 &lt;- degree.sequence.game(degs, method="vl")
all(degree(g5) == degs)
