<h2>Graph operators</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Graph operators handle graphs in terms of set theory.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
graph.union(...)
graph.disjoint.union(...)
graph.intersection(...)
graph.compose(g1, g2)
graph.difference(big, small)
graph.complementer(graph, loops=FALSE)
x %c% y
x %du% y
x %m% y
x %s% y
x %u% y
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<p>Graph objects or lists of graph objects.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>g1,g2,big,small,graph,x,y</code></td>
<td>
<p>Graph objects.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>loops</code></td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A graph is homogenous binary relation over the set 0, ..., |V|-1,
|V| is the number of vertices in the graph. A homogenous binary
relation is a set of ordered (directed graphs) or unordered
(undirected graphs) pairs taken from 0, ..., |V|-1. The functions
documented here handle graphs as relations.
</p>
<p><code>graph.union</code> creates the union of two or more graphs. Ie. only
edges which are included in at least one graph will be part of the new
graph. 
</p>
<p><code>graph.disjoint.union</code> creates a union of two or more disjoint
graphs. Thus first the vertices in the second, third, etc. graphs are
relabeled to have completely disjoint graphs. Then a simple union is
created. 
</p>
<p><code>graph.intersection</code> creates the intersection of two or more
graphs: only edges present in all graphs will be included.
</p>
<p><code>graph.difference</code> creates the difference of two graphs. Only
edges present in the first graph but not in the second will be be
included in the new graph.
</p>
<p><code>graph.complementer</code> creates the complementer of a graph. Only
edges which are <EM>not</EM> present in the original graph will be
included in the new graph.
</p>
<p><code>graph.compose</code> creates the composition of two graphs. The new
graph will contain an (a,b) edge only if there is a vertex c, such
that edge (a,c) is included in the first graph and (c,b) is included
in the second graph.
</p>
<p>These functions do not handle vertex and edge attributes, the new
graph will have no attributes at all. Yes, this is considered to be a
bug, so will likely change in the near future.
